# Python-based Chess Engine

A chess engine with a full chess representation written in Python. Supplied with a text client
that allows playing against the engine and a two-player mode.

## Usage

To use the text client, open a command prompt/shell in the project directory and enter:

#### Windows

> python .\chess_engine\text_client.py

#### Linux

> python3 ./chess_engine/text_client.py

Moves are entered in long algebraic notation (e.g. "e4-e5", "Qd7xd6").
