The information the move-checking function gets:
the piece, its type, location, destination, colour, capture status, en passant status, promotion status

if it is an en passant move:
- the move has to be diagonal

if it is a promotion:
- the destination must be in the enemy's first row (1 for white, 8 for black)

if it is a two-square move:
- the pawn must not have moved before
- the move must be straight forward - not diagonal

if it is a normal capture:
- the move must be one square forward and one square either left or right

otherwise:
- the move can only be one square forward
